          <p>Following list of projects isn't 100% complete compilation of my
            works.
          Some I forgotten, some I found too boring to list, some was just
            ordinary, prolonger bugfixing and testing stuff.
          List is semi-chronological. I tried to keep chronological order,
            but some of the projects start and end are blurry, overlapped or
            just couldn't recall it.</p>
          <h2>Voxcommerce Group sp. z o.o. Projects</h2>
          <h3>Biuranet.pl</h3>
          <p><span class="emphasis">General Role:</span> Developer</p>
          <p><span class="emphasis">Technology: </span> PHP, Cms2, Smarty, XML, jQuery</p>
          <p>Biuranet.pl is an realestate website with focus on the rental of the
            commercial spaces.</p>
          <p>Continuous (out of project) works included standard maintenance, bug fixing
            and incremental changes ordered by the client.</p>
          <h4>Filesystem Media Distribution</h4>
          <p><span class="emphasis">Role:</span> Sysadmin</p>
          <p>Media for Biuranet was kept in a single directory. After a years of
            successful operation it turned out there were few hundred thousands of
            leftover media, which was too much for filesystem to handle.</p>
          <p>The project was to redistribute files inside the filesystem in sensible way
            and reconfigure media handling inside application to conform to the new structure.</p>
          <h4>Search engine rework</h4>
          <p>Full rework of search engine to adhere to the new business rules.  As
            previous system couldn't be extended further project included
            re-implementation of search engine from the scratch and integrating it into
            existing website.</p>
          <h4>Import management</h4>
          <p>Biuranet.pl received a lot of imports from different sources. Some of them
            deviated from offer standard they used and had to be implemented on
            source-by-source basis. Project goal was creating the framework for
            per-source data decorators and a implementation of few such decorators.</p>
          <h3>Metrohouse S.A.</h3>
          <p><span class="emphasis">General Role:</span> Developer</p>
          <p><span class="emphasis">Technology: </span> PHP, Cms2, Smarty, XML, XSD, jQuery, MySQL</p>
          <p>Continuous works included standard maintenance, bug fixing and incremental
            changes ordered by software owner as well as maintenance of Metrohouse's
            database servers.</p>
          <h4>Initial frontend rework</h4>
          <p><span class="emphasis">Role:</span> Sole developer</p>
          <p>The project started at the point where any visual changes to a Metrohouse.pl
            website were unfeasible due to view code being present in the logic
            structures. Its goal was to separate this visual code in a shared Smarty
            templates.</p>
          <h4>Frontend SEO URL Rework</h4>
          <p><span class="emphasis">Role:</span> Sole developer</p>
          <p>Project goal was to change the way how offers was displayed. Due to
            complexity of realestate market, previous offer presentation was contextual
            and based on the search. Role was to clearly identify offer to present
            (without need for the context), display it and make sure offer identifier is
            the only thing that was presented in the url.</p>
          <h4>MSSQL -> MySQL migration</h4>
          <p><span class="emphasis">Role:</span> Lead</p>
          <p>Metrohouse S.A. had an issue with Microsoft SQL databases which shown various
            anomalies. Company's management decided to outsource it to Voxcommerce Group
            sp. z o.o. My role was to verify feasibility of such change, doing test run,
            recommending hardware provider for servers, migrate the date and transition
            systems to new DB backend.</p>
          <h4>Import management</h4>
          <p><span class="emphasis">Role:</span> Sole Developer</p>
          <p>Metrohouse backend system and frontend systems were separate and required
            data import/export in order to sync the offers. Those exports were usually
            big (>1GB) and contained XML definition as well as media data for offers.</p>
          <p>My responsibility was identifying the cause of failed imports and either
            bugfixing importer or providing bugreport for exporter. It was done through
            self-developed toolkit which could rapidly identify issues without parsing
            (or even reading) full import file.</p>
          <h3>Yelloow (work title)</h3>
          <p><span class="emphasis">Role:</span> Lead</p>
          <p>Yelloow was a realestate website for offer search/presenting. My role was to
            rework data model used in the backend to conform to modern realestate data set
            requirements (more compatible with set data standards in industry).</p>
          <h3>E-mail based CRM</h3>
          <p><span class="emphasis">Role:</span> Lead</p>
          <p><span class="emphasis">Technology:</span> Perl, Python, Linux, Postfix</p>
          <p>Project goal was to provide such plugin to one of developed CRMs, that would
            completely track client interaction and business flow solely from e-mails.</p>
          <p>Main challenge was preparing and keeping sample database from different
            e-mail clients and providers as well as complete test codebase, so that
            parsers and writers could be extended without producing regressions.</p>
          <h3>Infrastructure Management</h3>
          <p><span class="emphasis">Role:</span> Sysadmin</p>
          <p><span class="emphasis">Technology:</span>Perl, Shellscript, Linux, Munin, Zabbix, Apache, Nginx, MySQL, PostgreSQL, jQuery, Debian, Ubuntu, VPS</p>
          <p>Upkeep of Voxcommerce Group sp. z o.o. 6 Linux servers.</p>
          <p>Continuous work: performance monitoring, reliability monitoring, backend fixing</p>
          <h3>ETargi</h3>
          <p><span class="emphasis">General Role:</span> Senior/Sysadmin</p>
          <p><span class="emphasis">Technology: </span> PHP, Zend Framework, PostgreSQL, jQuery</p>
          <p>ETargi was a virtual exhibition system designed initially for Realestate.</p>
          <p>Continuous work included development and release management.</p>
          <h4>Search engine</h4>
          <p><span class="emphasis">Role:</span> Emergency Lead</p>
          <p>Shorty before official launch of the application major problem with search
            engine was found. The team was unable to fix it after few iterations so I was
            given the role of setting up a team and fixing the issue.</p>
          <p>The project consisted of full architecture analysis, plucking the old search
            engine and designing/implementing new one on very short deadline.</p>
          <h4>Data importer workflow optimization</h4>
          <p><span class="emphasis">Role:</span> Designer/Lead</p>
          <p>Data import was taking a huge chunk of team size, often taking few days to
            fix even minor issues. My role was to identify the issue and fix it, which
            resulted in 2-weeks microproject, during which new, contextless import
            mechanism was designed and developed.</p>
          <h3>Homebroker S.A.</h3>
          <p><span class="emphasis">General Role:</span> Developer</p>

          <p>Homebroker is one of the biggest realestate agents in Poland. My involvement

          <h4>CRM Payments/Invoices module</h4>

            automatic payment processing (through bank integration) and lean Invoice
            generation along with polish-law required invoice related features.</p>
          <h4>CRM Target module</h4>
          <p><span class="emphasis">Role:</span> Developer</p>
          <p>Complex module created for staff goal tracking. It gathered the data
            throughout the system using complex rulesets while providing additional
            information such as projected progress or expected money flow. My role was
            designing to design ruleset framework as well as implement rules based on
            business documents and provide the data dashboard for system users.</p>

          <p>One of the Homebroker's daily activity was preparing data export for
            partner. As often those exports were enormous in size (sometimes exceeding
            multiple GBs) they were rigid and slow to generate.</p>
          <p>Goal of the project was to provide system that would be able to shorten
            processing time while giving flexibility of a modification of entity on
            per-offer per-import-target level.</p>
          <p>My role was full setup of the project, including cost, budget and pitch for

            transitions or asset themes.</p>
